A single ship with a PDA can protect against any natural meteor strikes and deny easy terror bombardment of a planet’s population. The PDA cannot fully protect against orbital strikes by powered penetrators, but it can nudge them off course and make pinpoint strikes impractical. Most developed planets have much more powerful and effective ground installations, but a PDA-equipped ship is a useful emergency stopgap for poor or primitive worlds."
