The drill course regulator requires a sophisticated technical base and compatible metadimensional energy conditions in a given sector; many sectors no longer have this technology or lack the right environment to use it.

A cruiser can carry up to 1,000 colonists in stasis, while a capital ship can handle up to 5,000. Each further time this fitting is selected, these numbers double. These pods put their inhabitants into very deep hibernation so as to minimize the resources necessary to maintain their lives. Bringing them out of this stasis requires a month of “defrost”. Crash awakenings have a 25% chance of killing the subject. The pods are rated for 100 years of stasis, but their actual maximum duration is somewhat speculative."
