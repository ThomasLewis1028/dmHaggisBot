The settlement can be a deep-space hab, orbital installation, or planetary settlement. In the latter case, the ship must land to form the settlement; even ships without atmospheric operations can do so, but they can never take off again.

The drill course regulator requires a sophisticated technical base and compatible metadimensional energy conditions in a given sector; many sectors no longer have this technology or lack the right environment to use it.

    "Class": "Frigate",
    "Effect": "General equipment for the crew",
    "Description": "Much like an armory, this option allows a captain to lay in a general supply of equipment likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship’s locker in amounts commensurate with the ship’s size. A few guns and some basic armor might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete the locker until it is restocked."

    "Effect": "Allow another ship to hitch on a spike drive",
    "Description": "The ship is designed with symbiosis mounts that allow other ships to “hitch” on the craft’s spike drills. Each shiptender mount allows one craft of a hull size smaller than the tender to link up for intersystem drills. Mounts cannot be used for in-system travel. If the linking ship has been designed to be carried by a tender then establishing this link takes one hour. If not, it takes a full day to fit the ship into the mount. Ships can dismount from the tender with an hour’s disentanglement. In an emergency, the carried ships can dismount instantly, but the mountings are considered disabled then until repairs are made. Carried ships cannot fight."

    "Description": " Carefully-designed storage space intended to conceal illicit cargo from customs inspection. Each installation of this fitting adds 200 kilograms of cargo space in a fighter, 2 tons in a frigate, 20 tons in a cruiser, or 200 tons in a capital ship. Cargo in a smuggler’s hold will never be found by a standard customs inspection. Careful investigation by a suspicious official can find it on a difficulty 10 check using their Wis/Notice skill, and a week-long search one step short of disassembly will find it on a difficulty 7 check."

    "Effect": "Improved planetary sensory array",
    "Description": "Most ships require only basic analysis of a star system, sufficient to identify population centers, do rough scanning of an object’s composition, and chart major navigational hazards. Survey sensor arrays greatly enhance the ship’s sensor abilities, allowing for finely-detailed mapping of objects and planets, along with broad-spectrum communications analysis. They also improve attempts to detect other craft when scanning a region for stealthy vessels. Any rolls with survey sensor arrays add +2 to skill checks."

    "Description": "The ship’s standard drive-1 spike drive is removed and replaced with a different propulsion system. The ship is still treated as having a drive-1 for maneuvering and system transit purposes, but it cannot make interstellar drills. This modification lowers the cost of the basic hull by 10% and adds extra power and space based on the size of the hull: 1 power for fighters, 2 for frigates, 3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital ship hulls. Twice this amount of free mass is gained by the process."

    "Effect": "Pretech teleportation to and from ship",
    "Description": "This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in most sectors and was uncommon even on Mandate-era ships. The pads allow up to a dozen people or 1,200 kilograms of matter to be teleported to and from the surface of a planet or the interior of a another ship, provided it is no more than a few tens of thousands of kilometers distant. Ship-to-ship teleportation is possible only when the receiving ship is cooperating by transmitting accurate coordinate details; otherwise, a friendly, unjammed signal from inside is necessary to lock onto the target point. Planetary teleportations are possible only in the absence of physical barriers between the ship and the target point below. The teleporters may be used once every five minutes. In those rare sectors where this tech is widely available, it costs 200k."

    "Description": "Gravitic projectors allow the ship to manipulate objects within its immediate area, pushing, pulling, and sliding objects no larger than a ship of one hull class smaller. Targets with shipscale propulsion can resist the beams, but lifeboats, individual suit jets, or other smaller propulsors are inadequate. The beam can focus on only one object at a time but can move it into the ship’s cargo bays or hurl it out of the ship’s immediate vicinity within three rounds. The beams can only effectively manipulate objects in very low gravity, and not those on the surface of planets or other objects with significant natural gravity."

Any vehicles carried count as only half their usual cargo tonnage. Assuming trained operators, up to four vehicles can be offloaded or ramped onto the ship per round in cases where speed is critical."

A frigate-sized workshop is sufficient for modding any personal gear as per the modification rules on page 100. A cruiser-sized workshop can handle vehicle modding and starship maintenance, and a capital-class workshop can build vehicles or similar large work from scratch at full cost."
