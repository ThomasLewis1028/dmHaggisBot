Sometimes the consequences are worse still. Immiscible biospheres produce some of the most exotic plants and animals in human space.

            "Description": "Fewer than a million inhabitants are often found on newly-colonized worlds, or those with limited arable land. This class has the widest range of results, from societies barely large enough to avoid inbreeding to minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals struggling against hostile local conditions. For worlds with a very small population, settlements tend to be clustered close to one another for mutual support and efficient exploitation of land. The atmosphere might be something like that of a village-dotted countryside, with too few people to support large, specialized cities. The major settlement of the planet is usually built around the spaceport. Politics on planets with so few people tend to be very personal in nature. Individual leaders can sometimes address the entire population of a world at a single meeting, and networks of family, friends, and employees can dominate the local social life. This small population combined with limited outside contact can result in somewhat… unusual societies more strongly influenced by a leader’s personal quirks than a more populous planet might be. Some such worlds can grow decidedly unhealthy in their customs and traditions. Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants make up the population of many frontier worlds, usually ones with adequate supplies of arable land and surface conditions amenable to a human without a vacc suit or filter mask. This level of population is also usually the most that a world at TL4 can support using only artificial hydroponic complexes and sealed agricultural systems, so less hospitable planets rarely have more than this many inhabitants. At a hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states and hub settlements start to form, and some major political divisions might exist beneath the overall planetary government. Regional variations start to become present as towns and smaller settlements start to assert their own cultural traits. Young colonies rarely have much of a framework for resolving these new tensions, and it’s not uncommon for outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions. A hundred thousand inhabitants is normally the smallest population that can create spike driveequipped starships. Less populous worlds rarely have the broad range of specialists and workers necessary to build such ships, even if they possess the necessary technical information. Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of astronautic industry would require the determined focus of the entire society. Only at populations of a million-plus inhabitants is there enough of an industrial margin to allow for less determined construction of spike drive starships."

Those worlds with easy access to fossil fuels or a similarly energy-dense substance can advance to greater things, but a culture trapped at TL1 is unlikely to have access to such helpful resources. A few worlds have enough usable plant matter or other combustibles to make steam engines feasible, but those with very much of such a resource usually make the leap to the next tech level eventually. As a consequence, tech level 1 worlds tend to be caught at much the same general level of development as their tech level 0 cousins. They may have elaborate social structures and cultural development, but they are unable to mechanize without some energy-dense resource to serve as fuel. The scavenged hulks of their ancestors’ fusion plants may stand as mute temples to the achievements of their forebears, but without the tech necessary to repair and rebuild such edifices the world is dependent on purely local fuel sources. Tech level 1 worlds tend to respond to visitors in much the same way as tech level 0 planets. The ruling class of these worlds is liable to be able to muster larger cities, bigger armies, and all the other perquisites that come from being able to work the available agricultural land with fewer hands."

On worlds with an unbreathable atmosphere, control of the air supply makes it much harder for locals to rebel against their leaders. Without the equipment and power to generate their own air supplies, would-be rebels are entirely at the mercy of those who control the oxygen. Most rulers pick up on this fact rapidly, and some worlds with unbreathable atmospheres might even make it a crime to own illicit oxygen generation equipment"

If the world is otherwise amenable to Terran life, such planets can be enormously fertile and agriculturally rich. They can also be disasters waiting to happen. Pretech xenobiologists compiled standardized colonization packages of plants, animals, and insect life designed to expand smoothly and evenly to fill the niches of an uninhabited world. Not all colonists implemented these packages correctly, and some worlds had disasters or special circumstances that destabilized their efforts. Some empty worlds are now in a state of constant biological flux as the local ecology strives vainly to find some sort of equilibrium between the myriad imported species and their violent struggle. More subtly, these worlds can be suddenly and drastically destabilized by the import of some offworld plant or animal. With no strong native ecology to fight off interlopers, the wrong beast or bug can lay waste to whole continents. These planets tend to be extremely paranoid about importation of foreign life forms."

            "Description": "Tech level 3 worlds are those that have developed to a level much like that of the more advanced nations of late twentieth-century Earth. The main difference between tech level 3 worlds and level 4 worlds is the lack of fusion power or spike drive manufacture. These worlds come in two major varieties. The first is a “knockdown” world that formerly had tech level 4 technologies before some catastrophe or pirate attack destroyed their knowledge and industrial base. Some of the wrecked infrastructure might have been irreplaceable, and the world must struggle to regain its former level of technological production. Worlds in this condition tend to have rather small populations that are susceptible to the loss of a few concentrated groups of experts. The second major variety is a world that suffered a severe disaster shortly after colonization and has been forced to painstakingly build up their technological base ever since. Some of these worlds date back to the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago, driven into near-neolithic conditions by some outside pressure before slowly and painfully rebuilding their technological base through purely indigenous efforts. These worlds tend to have very large populations if the world’s climate permits, as they have been colonized for quite some time. Simply providing a world with the necessary technical data for advancement doesn’t mean that advancement will be quick or even. Even if a tech level 3 world has the necessary resources to build tech level 4 devices, it may take as much as a generation for a world to build the necessary infrastructure and resource extraction enterprises. The time may be longer still if the dominant cultures are uneasy with the new technology"

The resultant altered humans are often able to digest the local food, but commonly pay for it in shortened life spans, physical disabilities, or an inability to consume Terran foodstuffs. Sometimes the consequences are worse still. Immiscible biospheres produce some of the most exotic plants and animals in human space.

Colonial outposts tend to be better equipped but with less outside backing. Such natives expect to live and die on the world, and are more inclined to build permanent structures and local improvements. Many are exiles, malcontents, or others incapable of tolerating the world that sent them forth, and it can make for a somewhat explosive mix in a young colony.

Hybrid biospheres often show strange examples of symbiosis and adaptation, with plants and animals forming new alliances. Large predators from one world may find themselves subsisting on herds of herbivorous alien life, while Terran vegetation provides sustenance for large populations of small, furred, insect-like grazers.

The first is a “knockdown” world that formerly had tech level 4 technologies before some catastrophe or pirate attack destroyed their knowledge and industrial base. Some of the wrecked infrastructure might have been irreplaceable, and the world must struggle to regain its former level of technological production. Worlds in this condition tend to have rather small populations that are susceptible to the loss of a few concentrated groups of experts. The second major variety is a world that suffered a severe disaster shortly after colonization and has been forced to painstakingly build up their technological base ever since. Some of these worlds date back to the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago, driven into near-neolithic conditions by some outside pressure before slowly and painfully rebuilding their technological base through purely indigenous efforts. These worlds tend to have very large populations if the world’s climate permits, as they have been colonized for quite some time. Simply providing a world with the necessary technical data for advancement doesn’t mean that advancement will be quick or even. Even if a tech level 3 world has the necessary resources to build tech level 4 devices, it may take as much as a generation for a world to build the necessary infrastructure and resource extraction enterprises.

On worlds with an unbreathable atmosphere, control of the air supply makes it much harder for locals to rebel against their leaders. Without the equipment and power to generate their own air supplies, would-be rebels are entirely at the mercy of those who control the oxygen. Most rulers pick up on this fact rapidly, and some worlds with unbreathable atmospheres might even make it a crime to own illicit oxygen generation equipment"

            "Description": "Fewer than a million inhabitants are often found on newly-colonized worlds, or those with limited arable land. This class has the widest range of results, from societies barely large enough to avoid inbreeding to minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals struggling against hostile local conditions. For worlds with a very small population, settlements tend to be clustered close to one another for mutual support and efficient exploitation of land. The atmosphere might be something like that of a village-dotted countryside, with too few people to support large, specialized cities. The major settlement of the planet is usually built around the spaceport. Politics on planets with so few people tend to be very personal in nature. Individual leaders can sometimes address the entire population of a world at a single meeting, and networks of family, friends, and employees can dominate the local social life. This small population combined with limited outside contact can result in somewhat… unusual societies more strongly influenced by a leader’s personal quirks than a more populous planet might be. Some such worlds can grow decidedly unhealthy in their customs and traditions. Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants make up the population of many frontier worlds, usually ones with adequate supplies of arable land and surface conditions amenable to a human without a vacc suit or filter mask. This level of population is also usually the most that a world at TL4 can support using only artificial hydroponic complexes and sealed agricultural systems, so less hospitable planets rarely have more than this many inhabitants. At a hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states and hub settlements start to form, and some major political divisions might exist beneath the overall planetary government. Regional variations start to become present as towns and smaller settlements start to assert their own cultural traits. Young colonies rarely have much of a framework for resolving these new tensions, and it’s not uncommon for outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions. A hundred thousand inhabitants is normally the smallest population that can create spike driveequipped starships. Less populous worlds rarely have the broad range of specialists and workers necessary to build such ships, even if they possess the necessary technical information. Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of astronautic industry would require the determined focus of the entire society. Only at populations of a million-plus inhabitants is there enough of an industrial margin to allow for less determined construction of spike drive starships."

            "Description": "Tech level 3 worlds are those that have developed to a level much like that of the more advanced nations of late twentieth-century Earth. The main difference between tech level 3 worlds and level 4 worlds is the lack of fusion power or spike drive manufacture. These worlds come in two major varieties. The first is a “knockdown” world that formerly had tech level 4 technologies before some catastrophe or pirate attack destroyed their knowledge and industrial base. Some of the wrecked infrastructure might have been irreplaceable, and the world must struggle to regain its former level of technological production. Worlds in this condition tend to have rather small populations that are susceptible to the loss of a few concentrated groups of experts. The second major variety is a world that suffered a severe disaster shortly after colonization and has been forced to painstakingly build up their technological base ever since. Some of these worlds date back to the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago, driven into near-neolithic conditions by some outside pressure before slowly and painfully rebuilding their technological base through purely indigenous efforts. These worlds tend to have very large populations if the world’s climate permits, as they have been colonized for quite some time. Simply providing a world with the necessary technical data for advancement doesn’t mean that advancement will be quick or even. Even if a tech level 3 world has the necessary resources to build tech level 4 devices, it may take as much as a generation for a world to build the necessary infrastructure and resource extraction enterprises. The time may be longer still if the dominant cultures are uneasy with the new technology"

Humans can survive on warm worlds without more than appropriate clothing, but desert-world humans must learn sophisticated techniques of water prospecting and well-drilling in order to maintain their agricultural systems. Warfare often revolves around these water systems. The other common variety of warm world is one blessed with an abundance of surface water. These worlds tend to be covered with plant and animal life, teeming with thick jungles and vast mats of sargasso on seas that boil with piscids and other alien life analogs.

Pretech xenobiologists compiled standardized colonization packages of plants, animals, and insect life designed to expand smoothly and evenly to fill the niches of an uninhabited world. Not all colonists implemented these packages correctly, and some worlds had disasters or special circumstances that destabilized their efforts. Some empty worlds are now in a state of constant biological flux as the local ecology strives vainly to find some sort of equilibrium between the myriad imported species and their violent struggle. More subtly, these worlds can be suddenly and drastically destabilized by the import of some offworld plant or animal. With no strong native ecology to fight off interlopers, the wrong beast or bug can lay waste to whole continents. These planets tend to be extremely paranoid about importation of foreign life forms."

Unfortunately, the fact that humans can eat some native life means that it is very likely that some native life can eat humans as well.

Pretech xenobiologists compiled standardized colonization packages of plants, animals, and insect life designed to expand smoothly and evenly to fill the niches of an uninhabited world. Not all colonists implemented these packages correctly, and some worlds had disasters or special circumstances that destabilized their efforts. Some empty worlds are now in a state of constant biological flux as the local ecology strives vainly to find some sort of equilibrium between the myriad imported species and their violent struggle. More subtly, these worlds can be suddenly and drastically destabilized by the import of some offworld plant or animal. With no strong native ecology to fight off interlopers, the wrong beast or bug can lay waste to whole continents. These planets tend to be extremely paranoid about importation of foreign life forms."

This class has the widest range of results, from societies barely large enough to avoid inbreeding to minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals struggling against hostile local conditions. For worlds with a very small population, settlements tend to be clustered close to one another for mutual support and efficient exploitation of land. The atmosphere might be something like that of a village-dotted countryside, with too few people to support large, specialized cities. The major settlement of the planet is usually built around the spaceport. Politics on planets with so few people tend to be very personal in nature. Individual leaders can sometimes address the entire population of a world at a single meeting, and networks of family, friends, and employees can dominate the local social life. This small population combined with limited outside contact can result in somewhat… unusual societies more strongly influenced by a leader’s personal quirks than a more populous planet might be. Some such worlds can grow decidedly unhealthy in their customs and traditions. Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants make up the population of many frontier worlds, usually ones with adequate supplies of arable land and surface conditions amenable to a human without a vacc suit or filter mask. This level of population is also usually the most that a world at TL4 can support using only artificial hydroponic complexes and sealed agricultural systems, so less hospitable planets rarely have more than this many inhabitants. At a hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states and hub settlements start to form, and some major political divisions might exist beneath the overall planetary government. Regional variations start to become present as towns and smaller settlements start to assert their own cultural traits. Young colonies rarely have much of a framework for resolving these new tensions, and it’s not uncommon for outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions. A hundred thousand inhabitants is normally the smallest population that can create spike driveequipped starships. Less populous worlds rarely have the broad range of specialists and workers necessary to build such ships, even if they possess the necessary technical information. Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of astronautic industry would require the determined focus of the entire society. Only at populations of a million-plus inhabitants is there enough of an industrial margin to allow for less determined construction of spike drive starships."

The north pole of one world might be a sun-blasted desert that moderates to a cool, wet equator, or an icy world might be warmed here and there by complex channels of geothermally-heated subsurface rivers. Variable temperature worlds tend to have savage weather. The mixing of hot and cold air can send ferocious cyclones and raging hurricanes across the surface of the world, some large enough to consume most of a hemisphere. "

Whatever life exists on this planet has been extensively altered by an alien race or by advanced pretech gengineering methods. Some such worlds are paradise planets, carefully sculpted by some fabulously wealthy predecessor to suit their own tastes. Others are living forges, where foodstuffs and refined minerals are produced as byproducts from the basic organic processes of the world’s biosphere. Such worlds tend to be fragile. Many engineered worlds are dependent upon regular stabilizing work to prevent genetic drift and adaptations that do not serve the creator’s purpose. Without regular pruning and adjustment, engineered biospheres can go badly awry. Some end up leaving nothing but genetic wreckage in their wake, while others go wrong in more subtle ways. Where once the biosphere existed to serve the inhabitants, a creaking engineered biosphere can leave the planet’s population chained to constant repair and maintenance efforts just to prevent a planetary collapse."

          "Population": {
            "Type": "Fewer than a million inhabitants",
            "Description": "Fewer than a million inhabitants are often found on newly-colonized worlds, or those with limited arable land. This class has the widest range of results, from societies barely large enough to avoid inbreeding to minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals struggling against hostile local conditions. For worlds with a very small population, settlements tend to be clustered close to one another for mutual support and efficient exploitation of land. The atmosphere might be something like that of a village-dotted countryside, with too few people to support large, specialized cities. The major settlement of the planet is usually built around the spaceport. Politics on planets with so few people tend to be very personal in nature. Individual leaders can sometimes address the entire population of a world at a single meeting, and networks of family, friends, and employees can dominate the local social life. This small population combined with limited outside contact can result in somewhat… unusual societies more strongly influenced by a leader’s personal quirks than a more populous planet might be. Some such worlds can grow decidedly unhealthy in their customs and traditions. Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants make up the population of many frontier worlds, usually ones with adequate supplies of arable land and surface conditions amenable to a human without a vacc suit or filter mask. This level of population is also usually the most that a world at TL4 can support using only artificial hydroponic complexes and sealed agricultural systems, so less hospitable planets rarely have more than this many inhabitants. At a hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states and hub settlements start to form, and some major political divisions might exist beneath the overall planetary government. Regional variations start to become present as towns and smaller settlements start to assert their own cultural traits. Young colonies rarely have much of a framework for resolving these new tensions, and it’s not uncommon for outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions. A hundred thousand inhabitants is normally the smallest population that can create spike driveequipped starships. Less populous worlds rarely have the broad range of specialists and workers necessary to build such ships, even if they possess the necessary technical information. Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of astronautic industry would require the determined focus of the entire society. Only at populations of a million-plus inhabitants is there enough of an industrial margin to allow for less determined construction of spike drive starships."

Unfortunately, the fact that humans can eat some native life means that it is very likely that some native life can eat humans as well.

Alien civilizations appear to be no more immune to conflict, disaster, and decadence than that of humans, and most alien worlds are isolated planets. Some sectors were known to be dominated by alien empires before the Scream, but most inhabited worlds found by colonial surveyors consisted of indigenous, low-tech sapients who evolved on the world, or else were the decaying remnants of a former empire that had fallen apart into isolated colonial worlds. This fate of growth, expansion, colonization, and collapse appears to be a very common event in the galaxy. Countless alien ruins and lost deep-space artifacts indicate that cycles of growth and decay have been going on for millennia, and there is little way to tell how many alien empires have swept over what is now human space before dwindling to rotting worlds and then empty ruins."

The natives tend to be keenly aware of the glories of former generations, and work fiercely to redevelop lost techniques and reclaim old knowledge. Few tech level 2 worlds produce much that’s worth interstellar trade. Most foodstuffs are too bulky and cheap to make it worth a captain’s time. Some worlds have rare ore deposits, but the natives have no reason to dig them until a merchant makes it worth their while to set up a whole new industry for export. Some such worlds barter the relics of their ancestors in exchange for educational materials or rare resources necessary for advancing local industry.
